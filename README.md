# hypersax
Ongoing project to augment live saxophone performances using sensors.

Currently, an arduino nano on the saxophone can sense volume levels (Max4466 microphone) and sends it via RF components (NRF24l01) to an UNO on a laptop. The mic levels are visualized in Processing.

# brainstorming

## inputs
- volume of instrument (contact mic)
- instrument temperature
- xyz position (accelerometer/gyro)
- keypress (fixed ultrasonic)
- position on stage

## outputs
- LEDs: lights inside sax; wearable pendant; tangled strip; lights in clothes; LED cube/cubetype thing
- projection: max or processing
- house lights: max
- event triggers
